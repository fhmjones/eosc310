#### Overview: 
The biota have effected 
profound changes on the environment of the surface of the earth. At the same 
time, that environment has  imposed constraints on the biota, so that life 
and the environment may be considered as two parts of a coupled system. 
Unfortunately, the system is too complex and too little known for us to model it adequately. 
To investigate the properties which this close-coupling might confer on 
the system, we investigate  a model of an imaginary planet having 
a very simple biosphere. It consists of just two species of daisy of 
different colours and was first described by Lovelock (1982).


Because the black and white daisies have different
albedos, the relative proportion of black and white daisies
affects the amount of solar radiation which is absorbed or reflected back into space. 
The radiative balance of the planet is thus coupled to the growth of each species
of daisy. Likewise however, the growth of daisies is sensitive to the planetary
temperature: too cold or too cold, the daisies won't be able to grow.  
The growth rate of the daisies depends on only one environmental 
variable, temperature, which the daisies in turn modify because they 
absorb different amounts of radiation. Regardless of the details of the 
interaction, the effect of the daisies is to stabilize the temperature. 
The result arises because of the peaked shape of the growth-temperature 
curve and is independent of the mechanics by which the biota are assumed 
to modify the temperature.

This is an interactive Daisyworld model that calculates the evolution of the 
equilibrium temperature and surface area of daisies. This model is divided into two 
parts: the first one considers a planet orbiting a
star that is outputting a constant solar flux with time: this is characteristic of
older, more mature stars such as our present Sun. Early in Earth's evolution however,
the young Sun is expected to emit only about 70 percent of what it emits today. 
The second part of the model considers what happens when the amount 
of solar energy emitted by the star increases with time, such as for younger stars.
