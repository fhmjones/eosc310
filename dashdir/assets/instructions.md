##### Instructions: 
This is an interactive Daisyworld model that calculates the evolution of the 
equilibrium temperature of the planet's surface and the proportion of the planetary surface populated by daisies. The first part of the app (Tab 1) considers a planet orbiting a star that is outputting a constant solar flux with time. The second part (Tab 2) of the  model considers how the equilibrium state of the planet changes when the amount of solar energy absorbed by the planet changes with time. This model is interactive: using the sliders below, you can change the planet's distance from the Sun (part 1 only), the albedos of white and black daisies, the albedo of the bare planetary surface, and the planet's insulation factor to explore how these factors influence the planetary climate response. 
___

1. **White daisy albedo**: controls the albedo (reflectivity) of white daisies. Higher values mean more solar radiation is reflected back into space and the daisies absorb less sunlight.
2. **Black daisy albedo**: controls the albedo of black daisies. A lower albedo means more solar radiation is absorbed by the daisies.   
3. **Soil albedo**: the albedo of the background of Daisyworld in which the 
daisies grow. Uninhabited areas are covered in soil which has an albedo
in between that of the white daisies and the black daisies by default.   
4. **Insulation factor**: controls how much heat energy the daisies can hold onto after absorbing
solar radiation. If the planet were a perfect conductor (insulation = 0) the temperature would be
constant over the complete planet (instantaneous heat transfer between regions).    
5. **Distance from Sun (AU)**: controls how far the planet is from it's star and therefore how much solar radiation can reach the surface to heat it. Units are in Astronomical Units (AU), where 1 AU is equal to the Earth-Sun distance.
