##### Instructions: 

1. **White daisy albedo**: controls the albedo (reflectivity) of white daisies. Higher values 
mean more solar radiation is reflected back into space.  
2. **Black daisy albedo**: controls the albedo of black daisies. A lower albedo means more solar
radation is absorbed the the daisies.   
3. **Soil albedo**: the albedo of the background of Daisyworld in which the 
daisies grow. Uninhabited areas are covered in soil, which has an albedo
in between that of the white daisies and the black daisies.   
4. **Insulation factor**: controls how much heat energy the daisies can hold onto after absorbing
solar radiation. If the planet were a perfect conductor (insulation = 0) the temperature would be
constant over the complete planet (instantaneous heat transfer between regions).    
5. **Distance from Sun (AU)**: controls how far the planet is from it's star and therefore how much solar
radiation can reach the surface to heat it. Units are in Astronomical Units (AU), roughly
equal to the Earth-Sun distance.
